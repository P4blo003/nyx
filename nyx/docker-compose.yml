# Docker Compose file for deploying multiple Triton Inference Server instances.
#
# This setup separates inference workloads by nature:
# - Triton + vLLM for Large Language Models (LLMs).
# - Triton + ONNX Runtime for classical ML / DL models.
#
# The separation allows independent optimization, scaling and deployment.

# NETWORKS
# ==============================

networks:
  # Shared network for inter-service communication between core application services.
  common-net:
    driver: bridge
  # Internal bridge network used for communication between Triton containers
  # and any auxiliary services (API gateways, orchestrators, etc).
  # This network is not intended to be exposed externally.
  triton-net:
    driver: bridge
  # Network dedicated to metrics, monitoring and observability components.
